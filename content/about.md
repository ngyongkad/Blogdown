# About this site
The main motivation of setting up this site is to put together some of the materials that I came across and found relevant to credit risk analytics in retail space. 

In the retail space, data (even though not available publicly) is numerous and, therefore, powerful and versatile softwares are indispensable tools for processing them. Most practitioners in the field would undoubtedly use proprietary softwares in their works.  However, with continuous advances and innovations made in open-source softwares, the advantages of using proprietary softwares have become less obvious. The open-source software of choice on this site is R.   

It is hope that the materials on this site will be helpful to the practitioners.

# About the Admin
I am keen on data analytics and the technologies used to conduct it. I heard about R many years ago when I was in graduate school, but started using it only recently. I am now hooked for 2 reasons:
* R is not only **free** but also very powerful. In addition, many R packages that incorporated with cutting-edge methodologies are developed and/or maintained by top-notch researchers and developers. 
* Documentations on R is widely available and, again, for **free**. This includes the resources and materials I used to develop this site.  

Finally, I have more than a decade of working experience in credit risk analytics.  I reside in Malaysia. If you find the materials and information on this page useful, do consider buying me a coffee. :)
