Why putting up a blog? 

Totally by accident, I came across a [book](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/) written by the developer of `blogdown`. After spending less than one hour reading the first chapter, it seemed to me that I can put up a blog site fairly quickly. I decided to take up the challenge and the result is this site.

In fact, if one has some basic knowledge about RStudio and strictly follows the book's Chapter 1 and the first page of Chapter 3, a *bare-bone* site can be up and running within 2 to 3 hours.

However, if one would like to perform *continuous deployment* as suggested in Chapter 3.1, it is much more tricky.

What to blog?

Something that I know and interested in talking about will fit the bill. This turns out to be credit risk analytics.

Credit risk analytic is mostly (if not all) employed by heavily regulated financial institutions. Consequently, granular credit data are hardly publicly available for research purposes. Moreover, in pursuit of competitive advantage, any knowledge that gleamed from data and methodologies that used for knowledge extraction are often treated as intellectual property by financial institutions. 

Due to all these reasons, the flow of information and knowledge is impeded. With this blog, it is hope that best practices, methodologies, and technologies are spread for the benefits of the profession.
